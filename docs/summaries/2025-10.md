# October 2025 Summary

- Fix: Split divider position now persists per orientation between launches and no longer shifts during refreshes or UI toggles.
- UX: Eliminated post-launch animation divider jump by normalizing pane constraints and applying saved absolute pixel sizes early.
- Fix: Transcript pane now follows system Light/Dark changes when Appearance is set to System; previously it could remain in Dark after switching to Light.
