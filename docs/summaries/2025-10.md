# October 2025 Summary

- Fix: Split divider position now persists per orientation between launches and no longer shifts during refreshes or UI toggles.
- UX: Eliminated post-launch animation divider jump by normalizing pane constraints and applying saved absolute pixel sizes early.
- Fix: Transcript pane now follows system Light/Dark changes when Appearance is set to System; previously it could remain in Dark after switching to Light.
- Feature: Added a preference-controlled background mode that hides the Dock icon and keeps the app accessible from the menu bar.
- UX: Added a Show Agent Sessions shortcut to the menu bar item for reopening the main window while running in background mode.
- Fix: The Show Agent Sessions menu command now reopens the window even after it has been closed multiple times.
- UX: Restyled the menu bar indicator with stacked usage lines and signal bars for easier at-a-glance reading.
